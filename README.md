# Roll a Do

Roll a Do is a quick and easy to use to-do list app that was made in a single day. You can add tasks, check them off as finished, and roll a die to choose your next task at random. Constructed using Next.js and React Three Fiber, it provides a distinctive and lighthearted method of task management.
